Small KB sized Pin-BruteForce Tool.

Which is useful for Ethical Hackers as it Shows a Method that How Pin Bruteforcing Works.

Automatically Detect & Saves the Entered 2 to 6 Digit Pin into a very own Text File  "Pin.txt"

*Note* - This is Just For Educational Purpose, Not A Real Pin BruteForcing or Hacking Tool.
